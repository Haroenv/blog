A large part of every project is getting started, and that’s the position we’re currently in with team Moby Link (or mobylink, moby link, Mobylink, whatever you want for now), a project from [Data Science Lab](http://datasciencelab.ugent.be/), and we got a quite vague subject to work with:

> Show the advantage of _linked_ open data

This started with a few problems. First of all we didn’t _really_ know what linked open data was yet, second of all, how do you show what the example is and third of all who it’s for.

We started with discussions and looking up about things like `json-ld`, `RFDa` etc. (I’ll try not to bore you with implementation details), but we didn’t find enough clear information on our own.

At that point [Pieter](http://pieter.pm) explained us the point of linked data by relating links to URIs and gave us some datasets to convert (the Flemish traffic centre and the parking availability in Ghent). At this point we were able to create a demo for the hackaton, converting data and making data from scratch to show what needs to be done.

After that we decided to pivot into a project that explains the advantages of linked data to both people who haven’t heard of it ever, and to people who have vaguely heard of it and want to know implementation details.

As a gift because you’ve been reading my post for some time now (let’s guesstimate about a minute) you can get some sneak peeks of our “stories”. Keep in mind that this is the very initial part of the page and shouldn’t be taken at face value, merely as a guideline to show how far we will have come in the short coming three weeks
