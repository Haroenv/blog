Writing a first post on a blog is a pretty weird thing to do, But I'll try to explain what I've done here.

I've used this theme before, so I know it's working when I did [haroen.me/trip](https://haroen.me/trip).

Since then I've gotten a bit more knowledge on Jekyll, and I love it even more than I did then.

My posts will be about problems I've got and solved myself, maybe some photos from things I did and I thought were cool, or more explanation if some project I do needs it.
