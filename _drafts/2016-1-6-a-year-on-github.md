title: A Year of GitHub Commits
---
I've recently crossed the milestone of a year of continuous days with public GitHub contributions. Because this took me a while to achieve, I'm going to write up the things that happened during this time.

## Very first commit

I learned about GitHub two years ago thanks to @NorFairKing. At the time I was preparing for my first exam period in my study Physics and there was one very complicated course to me: Linear Algebra.

This course wasn't just complicated to me, it was complicated to most of us. That's why Syd (@NorFairKing) decided to make a summary with all the solutions of the questions posed in the book. Since he's a computer science major, he chose GitHub as a platform and LaTeX as a language to write the book in.
