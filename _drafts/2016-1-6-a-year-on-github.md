title: A Year of GitHub Commits
---
I've recently crossed the milestone of a year of continuous days with public GitHub contributions. Because this took me a while to achieve, I'm going to write up the things that happened during this time.

## Very first commit

I learned about GitHub two years ago thanks to @NorFairKing. At the time I was preparing for my first exam period in my study Physics and there was one very complicated course to me: Linear Algebra.

This course wasn't just complicated to me, it was complicated to most of us. That's why Syd (@NorFairKing) decided to make a summary with all the solutions of the questions posed in the book. Since he's a computer science major, he chose GitHub as a platform and LaTeX as a language to write the book in.

[This repository](https://github.com/NorFairKing/lineairealgebra) was the very first one I've added some content to, and introduced me to the world of sharing learning resources more than I had been before.

After the exams of January 2014 however GitHub kinda went to the back of my head. I was mostly doing other things.

## GitHub pages

During the summer of that year, I decided that our youth club @jwronline needed a new website (our old one had accidentally been taken down). I'd heard about [html5up](http://html5up.net), so I decided to temporarily switch some of the information towards a layout from there.

Before that I'd never touched html, css or javascript, so seeing a working site, with all the tags was a real interesting experience to me. Over the time of a week or two, I filled in the content and added some small tweaks to the design.

At this point I wanted to see it online to test whether or not it actually worked, and after some time I found out that you can have a repository on GitHub, and with a `gh-pages` branch, it got visible at `username.github.io/repositoryname`. This feature looked great for me, so it made me use GitHub again.

## In school

After that summer, I switched majors to electronics/informatics. During the first lesson of computer architecture, our prof @roelvs explained how he hosted the syllabus there, and that we could all make contributions (and that we'd get one point extra if we did).

Since I already knew how to use GitHub a bit, I jumped at the opportunity and put out pull requests for all the things I could think of to change. In the beginning most of this were small typos because I didn't understand the material enough, but during the exam period, I put some explanations of things I didn't find all that clear myself.

After a few lessons of my real programming courses, I noticed that it'd be nice to be able to share the homework exercises we needed to do, and I became to love being able to work on any machine, so I made a repository for that course too.

After that I felt like the sky was the limit. Why would you ever not share something? And to put that thought to actions, I open sourced all my lesson notes (Dutch, [notes-eoict](https://github.com/haroenv/notes-eoict)). And collected some contributions
